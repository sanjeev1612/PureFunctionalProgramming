Twitter Board
============

This package (*twitterboard*) contains the source code for 
a little Swing GUI application I named “Twitter Board.” It works 
a little like a  text-only version of Flipboard or an RSS reader.

Run the `TwitterBoard` object to see how the application works.
When you run the application, click the File menu, and then
click the Get from twitter menu item .
